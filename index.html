	   Hi everyone ! My name is Mégane Choupas and I am a 3rd year student at ESSEC Business School. I am really passionate about languages, communication and media. I also think it's pretty cool to learn how to code a bit.

	 <h2>Languages <i class="fas fa-language"></i> </h2> 
	 <p>I really love languages and learning new ones. I currently speak French, English and a bit of German and Spanish. I also got to learn some Chinese while in Singapore which was amazing.</p>
  </div>
	
  <div class="card-white">
  	 <h2>TV shows <i class="fas fa-film"></i> </h2>
	 <p> I am obsessed with TV shows. It's my way of relaxing. My favorite genre would be sitcoms but I also really enjoy drama.</p>
  </div>
	
  <div class="card-white">
  	 <h2>Reading and writing <i class="fas fa-book"></i></h2>
	 <p> I have always been passionate about reading all kinds of books and writing my own stories since I was a kid. </p>
  </div>
	
  <div class="card-white">
	 <h2>Communication and media <i class="fas fa-mobile-alt"></i></h2>
	 <p> These would currently be my favorite subjects and classes at Essec. I think I would like to work in these sectors in the future or maybe in journalism.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card-white">
	<h2>Buzzfeed <i class="fas fa-newspaper"></i></h2>
	<p>The last thing I have been obsessed with for quite some time would have to be Buzzfeed. It's a media where they write articles about really everything and also have the funniest quizzes. I tend to spend a lot of time on this website.</p>
